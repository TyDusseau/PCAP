# PCAP Investigation

## Objective

The objective of this cybersecurity project was to analyze a network traffic capture file (PCAP) suspected of containing malware by employing a comprehensive approach. I used Wireshark to examine network packets, identify anomalies, and pinpoint indicators of compromise. I leveraged PowerShell to generate and manage file hashes, and utilized VirusTotal to cross-reference these hashes against known malicious files. Additionally, I used Zui to view alerts related to the network traffic. My goal was to uncover and investigate potential malicious activity, understand the malwareâ€™s behavior and impact on the network, and enhance detection and response strategies for such threats.

### Skills Learned

- Proficient use of Wireshark for network packet analysis and anomaly detection.
- Skillful generation and management of file hashes using PowerShell.
- Effective cross-referencing and validation of file hashes using VirusTotal.
- Improved ability to detect and respond to network-based threats.
- Experience with Zui for monitoring and interpreting network alerts.

### Tools Used

- Wireshark to investigate and analyze the provided PCAP data.
- Zui to isolate and investigate alerts inside of the PCAP, uncovering more information about the suspected malware.
- Powershell to generate SHA256 file hashes to cross-reference with Virustotal.
